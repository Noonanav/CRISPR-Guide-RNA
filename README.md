# CRISPR_Guide_RNA

# About
Uses the model developed by Farasat/Salis to run a script that finds the best guide RNAs 
for a given gene (Target Sequence), Genome and any additional DNA sequences. The model is based on the 
information based on CAS9 and would be different for other CRISPR systems

The script is written using python v3 and cannot run on python v2. 

# How to use
Ensure that you have a file containing the gene of interest (Target Sequence), the genome of the organism (Genome), and 
any additional DNA present. The gene of interest must be present in the genome or the other additional DNA added to the script. 

To run the script, ensure you have the following libraries installed: 
  - Biopython
  - Tkinter 

navigate to the folder in terminal and type in

```
python Optimal_Guide.py
```

Follow the prompts on screen.
